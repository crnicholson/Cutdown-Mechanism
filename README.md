# Cutdown Mechanism
This cutdown mechanism is for a [high-altitude glider, named StratoSoar](https://github.com/crnicholson/StratoSoar-MK2). It is for releasing the glider from the high-altitude balloon payload, so it can fly down to the ground.

## Components
The cutdown mechanism consists of a few basic components, all easy to get and cheap.

- The PCB (more on this later).
- A SG90 standard blue servo.
- Arduino Nano.
- BME280 breakout board.
- A variety of headers.
- 9V battery clip.
- 9V battery.
- SPDT breadboard switches.
- One 10 K resistors.
- One standard 6 mm button.

## Funding 
SratoSoar currently has very limited funding to complete this project. We would love any outside support we could get to elevate (no pun intended) this project to the next level. Reach out to me if you have interest at:
